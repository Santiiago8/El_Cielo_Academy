                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>
                    El Cielo Academy is a premier circus arts academy offering structured programs based on age, skill level, and specialization in various artistic and athletic disciplines. One of our primary goals is to professionalize these disciplines and create career opportunities for individuals, both as coaches/trainers and performers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our academy emphasizes artistic development, athletic performance, recreational enjoyment, and competitive excellence, with a goal of fostering professional growth in the circus arts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "El Cielo" is Spanish for "The Sky," a name that reflects our academy’s philosophy of limitless possibilities and the expansive nature of the circus art. We believe that the sky symbolizes the freedom and creativity found in circus arts. Our goal is to help students reach their highest potential, explore their creativity, and achieve their dreams.

                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <p>
                    At El Cielo Academy, we believe that art is not just an activity, but a vital process for personal and emotional development. Inspired by Piaget’s idea that artistic expression is essential for a child’s growth, Vygotsky’s view that art reflects our historical and social context, and Montessori’s belief that art is a key element in human evolution, we strive to create a space where students can explore their passions, challenge themselves, and find their best selves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Ken Robinson explains, finding a passion, including art and sports, can lead to personal fulfillment and success. He emphasizes the importance of pursuing what you love and how sports can be a path to discovering your "Element." At our academy, art is a journey of transformation, where discipline and creativity come together to ignite your potential and inspire your future.

                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>
                    El Cielo Academy began in Argentina in 2014 when Professor Katherina Vega started her first academy in the north of the country. In 2018, she moved to Cairo, Egypt, and started a new circus arts and sports institution from scratch in 2021.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The academy is located in a gymnastics hall at The Field Community Club in Maadi.

                    In 2021 we hosted our first international workshop under the collaboration with Newsam aerial dance company, led by Monica Newsam & Graciela Newsam, reuniting all the community of aerial arts at the same hall. And, in December of 2021 we proudly joined the Azul Fest championship world as part of the organization and also competed with our students in the online edition, having 3 competitors with 1st place.

In August 2022 we joined for the 2nd year to Azul Fest Championship world, having 10 competitors and all with 2nd and 1st places in aerial silks and aerial hoop, with very good feedback from the judges. In September we hosted our first workshop of Argentinean dance, Folklore and tango with the Argentinean coaches Rocio Aquines and Eva Guerrero, having a good impact on our community.
